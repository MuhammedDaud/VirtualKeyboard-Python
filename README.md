Virtual Keyboard in Python

This project is a virtual keyboard built using Python's `tkinter` library. It provides a graphical interface with core keyboard functionalities such as Caps Lock, space, backspace, enter, and a hover animation effect for better interaction.

Features

- CapsLock: Toggle between uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Backspace: Deletes the last character in the input field.
- Enter: Adds a new line.
- Space: Inserts a space.
- Hover Animation: Buttons change color when hovered for a more interactive experience.

 Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` (usually pre-installed with Python)

Installation Instructions

1. Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can check the version by using your terminal or command prompt.
2. Verify that `tkinter` is installed by running a test. If `tkinter` is missing, you can install it using your system's package manager (e.g., for Ubuntu/Debian, use `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`).
3. Download or clone the project folder to your local machine.

Running the Virtual Keyboard

1. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory where the `virtual_keyboard.py` file is located.
2. Run the file using Python, and a window with the virtual keyboard will appear. You can interact with the keyboard by pressing the on-screen keys, and the input will be displayed in the text field.

Project Structure

- virtual_keyboard.py: The main Python file containing the virtual keyboard implementation.
- README.md: This file with instructions.

 Customization

You can modify this project to include more features, such as:
- Adding more keys like function keys or special characters.
- Changing the layout or color scheme of the virtual keyboard.
- Including advanced animations.
